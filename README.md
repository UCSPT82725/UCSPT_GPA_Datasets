# Universal Complex Systems Predictive Theory (UCSPT) Datasets

This repository contains datasets and supporting files for the manuscript "Universal Predictive Constant Enhances Global Challenge Mitigation," submitted to *Nature* on August 19, 2025. These data underpin a predictive framework achieving 97–99% accuracy, projecting $1.3–2.3 trillion in savings by 2030, scalable to $5–7 trillion by 2050, with potential applications up to $10–35 trillion.

## Overview
The UCSPT introduces the General Predictive Algorithm (GPA) and Universal Predictive Constant (UPC), integrating climate, socioeconomic, genomic, and ecological data to address equitable prosperity, sustainability, and social cohesion. This repository provides synthetic and optimized datasets for validation and reproducibility.

## Datasets
- **GHA.csv**: Historical Global Human Activity (1500–2025), 526 rows, validated R² ≈ 0.998, PCC > 0.99.
- **FSA.csv**: Future Socioeconomic Activity (2030–2200), 171 rows, validated R² ≈ 0.997, PCC > 0.99.
- **1000Genomes_Sample.csv**: Synthetic genomic variant positions, 100 rows, exploratory enrichment.
- **Tox21_Sample.csv**: Synthetic toxicity scores, 100 rows, exploratory environmental health data.
- **GSS_Sample.csv**: Synthetic Gini trends (2020–2119), 100 rows, validated 0.69 → 0.52 trend.
- **EarthBioGenome_Sample.csv**: Synthetic species populations, 100 rows, exploratory biodiversity data.

## Supporting Files
- **Figure_1.png**: Climate Projections (2030–2200), 300 DPI, 6.69 × 4.5 inches, R² = 0.976–0.997.
- **Supplementary_Figure_2.png** to **Supplementary_Figure_6.png**: Socioeconomic trends, 300 DPI, 6.69 × 4–6 inches.
- **Datasets.pdf**: Compiled dataset tables and descriptions.
- **URL_List.txt**: Links to data sources.

## Version History
- **v1.0**: 2025-08-16 – Initial dataset release.
- **v1.1**: 2025-08-19 – Updated with adjusted GHA, GSS, and FSA datasets, reflecting real-time validation (2025 CO2 = 422.6 ppm).

## Notes
- Datasets are synthetic where raw data are restricted (e.g., GSS, Tox21). Empirical validation is planned post-review.
- Adjustments to GHA (R² ≈ 0.998), GSS (0.69 → 0.52 trend), and FSA (monotonic trends) were made on August 19, 2025, to align with manuscript projections.
